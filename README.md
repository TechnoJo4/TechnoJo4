## Hi, I'm Jonas!

I play CTFs and enjoy programming language design and implementation.

You can read my CTF writeups [on my website](https://merkletr.ee/ctf).

I currently work at [Dimonoff](https://www.dimonoff.com/), study Computer Science at [USherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/), and volunteer as VP Compétitions of [JDIS](https://jdis.ca/).

You might also know me from developing [the base library](https://gitlab.com/shosetsuorg/kotlin-lib/) and [some extensions](https://gitlab.com/shosetsuorg/extensions) for Shosetsu, a novel reader app for Android.
